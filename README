A simple set of scripts to help explore Tate's collection dataset.

* Licensing

Code is GPLv3+, data is CC0.

* Prerequisites

This project requires mongodb, node.js and the node "mongodb" and "csv libraries.

npm install mongodb
npm install csv

* Importing The Tate Collection Data Into MongoDB

Check out the Tate collection git project:

https://github.com/tategallery/collection

either directly into this folder, or elsewhere and link it in as "collection":

ln -s ../../path/to/collection

Git will ignore it.

To import the records into MongoDB you have to feed records in one per line.
Like this:

find collection/artists -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artists --stopOnError --drop
find collection/artworks -name *.json -exec perl -p -e 's/\n/ /' '{}' \; -exec echo \; | mongoimport --db tate --collection artworks --stopOnError --drop

Note that this will delete any existing data in these collections.

* Usage

Install the prerequisites, Import the Tate data into MongoDB, then type:

make

This will generate any csv files that don't already exist.

If you need to remake them after updating the MongoDB data, type:

make clean
make
